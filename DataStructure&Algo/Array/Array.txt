-> An array is an indexed sequence of components
    * The components of an array are all of the same type
-> Typically, the array occupies sequential storage locations
-> Array is a static data structure, that is, the length of teh array is determined when the array is created, and cannot be changed
-> Each component of the array has a fixed, unique index
    *Indices range from a lower bound to an upper bound
-> Any component of the array can be inspected or updated by using its index
    * This is an efficient operation: O(1) = constant time
